# Prototypes & Test Pages

This folder collects prototype HTML pages and ad-hoc test utilities so they donâ€™t clutter the production frontend or backend sources.

- Root prototypes moved from `ShadowMap/shadow-map-frontend/`.
- React-specific test pages moved from `ShadowMap/shadow-map-frontend/react-shadow-app/`.
- Dev-only utilities moved out of `react-shadow-app/src/`.

Use `scripts/organize-prototypes.sh` to relocate existing files.
